☐ Cleanup.
☐ Document the logic behind validating the hash.
☐ Undo "deliberately and explicitly ask curl/libcurl to ignore certificate validity".
☐ Support inherits from an expression (maybe rewrite on-the-fly such that unsafeGetAttrPos can be called on the attrset from which is inherited).
☐ Support bindings and inherits from function attrset arguments, like abydos.
☐ Support bindings and inherits for any arbitrary identifier by going all out:
We could check all files for the hash output literal string (track this with scopedImport).
We could check functionArgs if they are constructed by a simple function application.
We could support arbitrary complex expressions in between by checking the output of such expressions
and seeing if we can find literals that match them at the call site of the output hash.
We could see if hnix evaluation could be used to try and track the bindings.
☐ Why does gcc48 not have src, while its file clearly defines it, maybe it could indicate that we need an extra way to look for package sources.
